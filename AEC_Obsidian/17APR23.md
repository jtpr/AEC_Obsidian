## Notes
- File was recovered at work :))
- All work done on 4/14 has been reset
- Prioritization
	- Asphalt Curbs
	- Asphalt Striping
		- From 2021
	- SESC plan
- All curb stuff is complete!!
- I finally figured out the way to copy over the files correctly! I needed to move the 2021 striping file with them and point it at the correct area.
- I can then clip it in the references tab.
