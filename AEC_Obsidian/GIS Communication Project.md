# GIS Communication Project
## 1. What sections will be fixed?
- Needed so I know what to **not** report to GIS
- This is the Bid Folder -->
	- G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00017748 - FY20 & FY21 W&S - Sanitary & Storm Sewer System Maintenance Repairs\Design\OHM Bid package
- There is a couple "map books" in the folder that show an a **base bid**, **Alternate 1** and **Alternate 2**. 
- Which part of the bid did we go with? 
	- Assume the base bid was accepted, start with those
	- Man I am just very lost with the sewer GIS stuff. Maybe email OHM for their videos and tables?
- Based on [[P17748_BP2_Drawings_02_11_22.pdf]] I determined that the only pipes that were being worked on were
	- 74-U00060
	- 74-65441
	- 74-65522
	- 95-92034
	- 95-90527
	- 95-90528
	- 95-90658
- I found this email --> [[University of Michigan Mail - P17748 Bidpack 2 Budget.pdf]] that references each alternate and what they are. 
- I found this table that has the bid scope of each pipe! *G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00017748 - FY20 & FY21 W&S - Sanitary & Storm Sewer System Maintenance Repairs\Construction*
- I found this document as well: [[74-71473 sewer abandonment.pdf]] --> Noting abandoned changes from 4/15/21
- I found this note from Alex Bade of OHM from 3/11/21 -->[[GIS files Transmittal - 007.pdf]] which states that the GIS data was transferred already --> Sent a follow up email. 
	- *G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00017748 - FY20 & FY21 W&S - Sanitary & Storm Sewer System Maintenance Repairs\Correspondence\AE*

## 2. Where are the videos/condition?
- I was looking at the Deliverables table in (G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00017748 - FY20 & FY21 W&S - Sanitary & Storm Sewer System Maintenance Repairs\Design\Condition Assessment Report) but most of the selected pipes for work do not have conditions?
