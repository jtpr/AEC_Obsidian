		- As such, I think there may be more void under the ramp. It is steel reinforced, so if it were just laying on soil the steel wouldn't be needed. 
		- When they expanded the plaza they removed the stairs, I need to find out if they filled in under the ramp.

- Meeting at Gerstacker
	- Some confusion still over how the water is getting into the shaft.
	- Check if the slab the elevator is connected to is a structural member
	- Check slopes further south
	- Use a laser to check the maximum allowable slope
	- Email sent to building manager Tony Martin (tonamar@umich.edu)
		- Asking if he can lower the elevator and we can check it out.
