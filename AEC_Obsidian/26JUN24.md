# Plan
- ~~Finish + Send Report to Mark~~
	
- Get all of the rest of the data into the databases for the sidewalk program.
	- Done with all but the entry of Grid 10
- Set up easy sheets (To work on when I'm back)
- Look into KML integration with AutoCAD (To work on when I'm back)

# Record
- Laser worked much better today! Not as light out lol.
- Sent my report to Mark, need to figure out where to file it though.
	- Email from Mark: 
		- Looks good.  Go ahead and put an exhibit together for the 1-11 straight option.  Assign spot #1 as 0.00 elevation, show dimensions off of known locations so we can locate them in the field, and label the longitudinal and cross slope.
		- One side note, when you do this in the future (and at Stantec) it is standard to use feet and tenths of feet rather than inches.
	- Sent out!
