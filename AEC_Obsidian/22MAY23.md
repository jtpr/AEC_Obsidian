# Record
- I need to finish the edits to the sidewalk program today as well. 
- I Messed up the patch pages by not having them reference the design base file, only the stationing file so:
	1. Replace stationing.dgn with Design Base.dgn
	2. Clip around the appropriate grid
	3. Turn on in Presentation:
		1. Line Weights
		2. Line style
		3. Dimensions
		4. Fill
		5. Level Overrides
		6. Patterns
		7. Text
	5. Grey out basemap using level overrides on all CM layers
	6. Add note
	7. When done with all grids, remove the grid file from the design base

GOSD DAMN IT
- I messed with the base map and need to reset the base map.
- That will be a tomorrow issue.
