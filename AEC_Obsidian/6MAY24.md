# Plan
- Set up google home for 2024 inspection.
# Record
- So ITS took my old desktop, and I have to reinstall everything now
	- I reinstalled
		- AutoCAD
		- Obsidian
		- Github
		- Power Toys
	- I'm hoping to install winaero tweaker to get the windows 10 right click menu back, remove copilot and the internet search in the start menu.
		- IDK if I can do that tbh. That might be a bit too far
- I was able to fix the ISR plaza and Hill Auditorium sheets in the sidewalk program
- I got some comments on the Gerstacker page
	- Measure height of curb
	- Find out where the drainage cap is.
- Got a basic schedule set up here:
