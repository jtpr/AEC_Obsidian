# Record
- Going over NCRC Email
	- Yellow road striping around the entire 2800 ring road
	- Needed along Baxter road where it connects at the southwest corner of the ring road
		- Crosswalk hashmarks could also use a new coat
		- Stop bars at and around the entrance of doc 90
	- 2800 Side
		- In lot NC95: One way designations going in and out of the drop off location (see attachment 1)
		- Near NC100 there is a crosswalk that needs to be marked (2nd attachment)
	- 1600 Side
		- West entrance to the 1600 side: 2 crosswalks with lane markings exiting the property at the west entrance. Left lane straight arrow. Right lane right turn arrow.
		- Yellow Line in ring road around 1600. Start at the south end of NC84 or the pay-to-park on the west side. Follow the road south as it wraps around the south end of 1600 and heads north to Plymouth
	- Baxter road (may not fall under NCRC)
		- Section that surrounds NC90 & NC91
- Surveying
	- I went out and took photos of the survey zone and created a document using my iPad that contained much of the necessary information.
	- Find it here: G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00020675 - 2023 Asphalt Maintenance Program\Design\NCRC
	- I should try to find a good program for editing vector graphics to help communicate my concepts
		- Right now I'm mostly using my iPad's goodnotes and AutoCAD
