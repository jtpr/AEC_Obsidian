# Record
- Gerstacker
	- Check if the slab the elevator is connected to is a structural member
		- The record drawings for the 1999 expansion do not include the structural drawings, so I couldn't tell.
		- But there are drains embedded in the shaft? so I'd assume they are structural
	- Check slopes further south
	- Use a laser to check the maximum allowable slope
	- Setting up a meeting with Tony the building manager
		- Waiting for Email
