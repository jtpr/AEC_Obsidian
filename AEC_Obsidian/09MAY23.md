# Record

- I now understand that I need to measure all of the stripes that we maintain on campus.
	- Roads that are not striped:
		- Gilbert Ct (S of Sterns Building)
		- Hubbard Drive to Baits 1
		- Dean Rd. is AA owned?
		- Draper Dr. to MFly and NAME/Wilson Center
		- NW45 Entrance
		- NW40 entrance
		- NW33 Entrance
		- EW section of Bonnisteel
		- Duffield Dr. to Bursley
		- Hubbard Drive to Bursley
		- NW V
		- Unsure about Simpson Dr.
		- Nichols Drive
		- Richard L Kennedy
- Still to do with the striping thing:
	- NCRC is not included as of 05/09/23
	- Dashed white lines are calculated as the total length they cover, not the amount of paint used. Unclear on how to price this at the moment.
