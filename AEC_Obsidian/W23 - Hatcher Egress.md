# Hatcher Egress Plan
- Fire Escape stairs need some concrete connection at their egress point. 
- Specifically looking at Door 1523
- I created an example file at: G:\0000001 - Multiple Blocks\Projects\P00020285 - 2023 Sidewalk Program\Design\Hatcher egress paths
- I need a new survey file from the Surveyor that includes the Sewer and Electrical Lines. (Waiting on this from Anne)
