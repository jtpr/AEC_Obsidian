# Record
- Waiting for responses from FO GIS and NCRC about striping. 
	- FO GIS says they'll get back to me
- From Anne
	- Draft the Crack Seal Locations for Asphalt
	- Walk through with Anne at a later time
	- Roll from last year and last 2 years

- Locations on NC that need to be inspected. (ADD TO THE PRIMARY Walks AND OWNERSHIP MAPS)
- Renamed the Orifice Plate to SD334200 001 - Orifice Plate with Debris Screen (SD 334200 is for Storm water Management) -> Sent to Patti Spence
- Fixed bike dimensions through the center of the hoop as Anne requested -> Sent to Anne.
- Lots of New Stuff!
	- Started using [Connect Pictometry](https://explorer.pictometry.com/) to measure distances of striping on campus. 
	- Somewhat finicky, was not able to add Anne to my project 
	- Make sure to pin all of the measured distances
