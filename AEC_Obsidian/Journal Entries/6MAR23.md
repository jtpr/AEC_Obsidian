## Notes
- Had to fix Grid 20 --> Done
- GO ON ALL ATHLETICS LOCATIONS + MORE ARE COMING
- Started going over the sidewalk specifications
- Goal is for senior review by end of next week, so this is the real crunch time
- Hatcher Sketch is good! Put it into the main sheet and start messing with layers to make sure everything plots correctly. (Maybe ask Micah)
