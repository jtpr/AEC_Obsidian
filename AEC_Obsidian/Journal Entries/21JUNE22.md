## Record
- Planned out day
- Met with mark about the MLB slope measurements
	- When using figures I need to be more clear what is what, add a little more detail
	- You have to specify what way the % slope is pointing
	- Next steps
		- Go take larger perspective photos
		- Draw on the photo with the limits of what needs to be replaced
		- Estimate the SF
- Surveying was slow today, just lots of ground to cover with lots of issues.
- Got the photos uploaded
- Started [[ADA Training 1]]
