## Record
- Planned out day and Grid Marking
- I was able to get the finished road condition map done within Microstation, I now just have to print it in color, which is giving me problems. 
- Going out on my sidewalk marking time!
- I was able to print the Road Condition Map in Color! Now I just have to add the graphs on the bottom once I get that data.
- I spent around 2 hours working on the change order and re-familiarizing myself with AutoCAD. 
	- I copied the page and started adding arrows.
	- All of the details that need changing are in [[12MAY22]]
