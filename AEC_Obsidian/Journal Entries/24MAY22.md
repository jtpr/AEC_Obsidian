## Record
- Email from Mark about the asphalt program
	> Make an archived folder and save everything in its current state for reference before making the changes.  As you make the changes you will need to keep a written log of the comments and our responses to those comments (e.g. "revisions made as noted").
	> Skip any comments you aren't comfortable with and we can meet to review them. 
- Got through my first pass of the Asphalt program, only waiting on Mark now to help me review the comments I didn't know, this took quite a long time, I won't lie
- Did some Admin work, copying stuff
- Started work on GIS Stuff
	- [[GIS Communication Project]]
	- I installed ArcGIS, didn't do much
- Spent most of today just trying to wrap my head around the GIS Project.
