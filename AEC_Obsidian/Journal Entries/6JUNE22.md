## Plan
- [x] Safety Training (Due Today) ~0.25
- [x] GIS Communication
	- [x] Go through email communication
	- [x] Large Printout of Sewers in the area so I can draw on them
		- [x] Start with the smaller areas (2,3,4)
	- [x] Determine if those smaller areas were part of the base bid or not
	- [x] Start annotating areas 2, 3, 4
## Record
- Started with some email, went over the what work needs to be done still.
- Priorities appear to be:
	1. SESC Complete Plan
	2. Sidewalk 2023 surveying
	3. GIS Data Communication
- Short Meeting with Micah
	- Training the 23 Sidewalk program on Thursday
- Started work on the SESC Complete Plan, I filled out the form Anne sent me as best I could --> Sent to Dharmesh
	- Got some comments from Dharmesh back
	- Found the silt sack installation detail and the SESC note language, missing the sequence language. 
	- Emailed Tony to ask about the language
	- Made changes and printed out at the big plotter, pretty much done.
- Started work on the GIS Stuff
	- The GIS team made a dropbox for the data from the sewer repair survey
	- I printed out the OHM inspection sheets around the diag to try and match the bid to the inspection
	- I assumed the base bid was accepted and crossed off those segments from the map
	- I emailed Andrew to ask for help about which bid was accepted. 
		- Still no word at 2pm
	- I printed out the bid documents and found a table of work being done, now I just need to find the videos/condition of each other segment than these few. 
	- More notes taken in [[GIS Communication Project]]
