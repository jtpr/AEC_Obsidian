## Record
- Started with email
- Started looking for who I should contact at OHM about the video files
	- Found a note from Alex Bade (alex.bade@ohm-advisors.com) which states the BP1 PACP Inspection GIS Data was delivered to Ray Garrett
	- Had a short meeting with Mark where he told me just to throw what I have at them and let them work it out
- I spent most of the rest of the day scanning stuff. Oh well. 
- Also, the South U starbucks union vote failed, eesh.
