# Record
- Started work with the new GIS instructions
	- Looking at the As-Built sheets highlighted work that was done
	- Need to confirm if the repairs stated were actually placed in GIS following the work done
- Started planning my survey work
- Went out and surveyed. Worked on my report for Mark. 
- Quick Task from Anne --> Email GIS with the PASER Map and ask them to add it as a layer. This is useful so other departments can coordinate replacing other infrastructure with existing road repair. 
- Kept working and got photos in the drive with locations in the google map as well. 
- Spend [[21JUNE22|tomorrow morning]] working out some time blocking to get all tasks accomplished
