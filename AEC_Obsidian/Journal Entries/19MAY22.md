## Record
- Started with some simple day planning
- Got decently far with the SESC plan, replacing what I could on the sheet and with information from GIS. However, I got stuck when I tried to add the sewer layers and other details.
- Went out and marked all of C-27 and C-28, no problems
	- Make sure we print the paver specifications for 27-13 as I didn't mark them
	- I started fixing most of the other CAD and database fixes I needed to and am about 87% done.
- Went out and took ADA slope measurements around the BSB area, and started preparing a small diagram
- Took lunch and emailed diagram to Mark.
- Started working on some of the Admin Work
- Meeting with the Architecture Group, not too much to takeaway, just lots of people
- Started work again on the SESC Plan that must contain
	1. ~~Legal Description~~
	2. Site Location Sketch
		- Can I just leave it with the current descriptors?
	3. ~~Proximity to nearest water of the state~~
	4. ~~Predominant land features~~
	5. Contour Intervals / Slope descriptions
	6. ~~Soil survey / written descriptions of soil types of the exposed land area~~
		- Found More Recent Data from https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx
	7. Description and location of the physical limit of each earth change
		- Make big dotted line
	8. ~~Description and location of all existing and proposed on-site drainage and dewatering facilities~~
	9. Timing and sequence of each proposed earth change
	10. Location and description for installing and removing all temporary SESC measures
		- Add Descriptions
	11. Description and location of all permanent SESC measures
		- Restore disturbed turf grass with seed and mulch blanket. 
		
	12. Program for the continued maintenance of all permanent SESC measures that remain after project completion. Include the designation of the person responsible for the maintenance.
- SESC Plan appears to be going decently well, but I need to add contour lines which may be a *pain*.
