## Plan
- [x] Create Rough Cost Estimate of Hatcher Egress based on Drawings from Friday
	- [x] Email Rob Daneloski about the Tree
- [ ] Organize how complete each page is, compared against the Y's in the database
	- [ ] Like my spreadsheets over the summer
	- "I am envisioning a schedule identifying the number of grids that need to be completed weekly to get us to senior review at the end of February.Â  I think you did something similar last year where you scheduled out the grids you were inspecting over the summer."
- [ ] Grid 8 CAD Completed

## Record
- Cost estimation was messed up, redo and send to anne.
