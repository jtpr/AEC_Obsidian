## Record
- Called MDOT about pulling the CAD file, no luck :( the PDF is all I'll get, so I need to sketch it. 
- Met with Rich and Andrew out in the field. They're all doing just fine.
- Surveyed most of G14 and started G13. I just need to survey that little courtyard up by the dude to finish G14
	- Goal for [[15JULY22]] finish G14 and G13 
- I placed the G21 photos on the map and G14 (missing the dude courtyard)
- I want to finish G13 then place them
- Email from Anne
	- Check for sensitive areas coming up next week, **emphasize with Rich**.
	- The NCRC location 4-290 is scheduled for **July 22**
- Rich raised come concerns about location 10-15. We'll talk when she's back on vacation.
