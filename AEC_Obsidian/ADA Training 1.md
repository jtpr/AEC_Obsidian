# ADA Training
## SIDEA Request
- Students inclusion Diversity Equity and Accessibility Board
- Issued report about the gaps in UM DEI and Accessibility for Students
- Recommended all designers should be trained in ADA laws 
## Review of Universal Design Principles
1. Equitable Use
2. Flexibility in Use
3. Simple and Intutative Use
4. Perceptible Information
5. Tolerance for Error
6. Low physical Effort
7. Size and space for approach and use

## Laws and Scope
ADA - 1990
ADAA - 2008 Amendment, opened the scope of the law
- Title II State and Local Government (Includes UM)
- Title III Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities (also includes UM)
ADAAG - Guidelines (code requirements to meet the mandated requirements)

Code Requirements: HOW
- Michigan Building Code (2018)
- 2010 ADAAG
- ANSI A117.1 2017 (Post march 2020)

ADA Scope Requirements: WHO
- All facilities available to the public
- Includes almost everything in the University

What is required to be accessible?
- Everything without an exception (mech and electrical rooms, etc)

## Accessibility Code Building Blocks
- Understanding the application of the code
	- Differentiates between new and existing buildings (Pre Mar 2020)
	- If code-required dimensions are a single number, you can use standard construction tolerance (1/4")
	- If code-required dimensions are given as a range, no range is allowed
	- Don't select the dimension at the limit of a range (ex: 15" - 18", select 17")
- Changes in Level
	- 1/4" change in level can be vertical
	- 1/4" - 1/2" change must be beveled w/ slope no greater than 1:2
	- 1/2" and higher change in level must be damped
- Floor surface
	- 67" turn radius
	- only 10" table overlap
	- T-shaped turning space should use champered edges. 
	- Clear floor space is now 30 x 52 inches in new buildings

> This is a problem of dignity issue. This is why we need to integrate this into design at the beginning of the design.

- Knee and Toe Clearance
	- Space underneath tables are specified
	- Must be at least 13" inches wide with 17" at the least
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621150809.png]]
- Protrusions
	- overhangs must be detectable by can users
	- nothing lower than 80" high or 4" from the wall
	- Under stairs are often areas that need built detercation areas
	- Common issues: AEDs, Fire Extinguishers, Drinking fountains, Laptop bars
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621150739.png]]
- Reach Range
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621150720.png]]
- Walking surfaces
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621151014.png]]
	- There are new requirements for 90 degree turns with larger weelchairs
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621151106.png]]
	- Before Mar 1 2020, you can do 36in to 36in
	- Passing spaces should be used in narrow passageways every 200 ft or intersections
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621151247.png]]
- Doors, Doorways and Gates
	- Depends on how you interact with the door
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621151432.png]]
	- How much clear floor space you need is determined by this table
	- More measuring requirements for **two doors or gates in series**
		- ![[Pasted image 20220621151602.png]]
	- Hardware / opening mechanism
		- ![[Pasted image 20220621151654.png]]
		- Certain lb force requirements (push/pull: 15 lbs, rotational motion: 28 lbs)
	- Automatic Power
		- Not technically needed. But UM Code requires 1 per accessible doorway
- 405 Ramps
	- Need Landings, Ramp runs
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621152637.png]]
- Curb ramps and Blended Transitions
	- Transitions to parking
- Elevator Dimensions
	- Depends on the type of car
	- Needs visual and auditory cues for direction
- Parking Spaces
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621153014.png]]
	- Accessible route should be physically separated from the flow of traffic
	- Parking meters must be on a level panel
	- EV charging cables cannot be on the accessible route. 
- Stairs (504)
	- ![[Pasted image 20220621153154.png]]
	- Min rise 4"
	- Max rise 7"
	- Track 11"
- Windows (506)
	- lb force requirements
