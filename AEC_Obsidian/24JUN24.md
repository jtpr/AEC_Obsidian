- Prep Routes + Measure ramp elevations
# Record
- Worked a lot on prepping for my ramp design survey
- Check with mark to see if this is too granular
	- I'm thinking it might be a little too much
	- Maybe just shoot an elevation at the middle of the hill to get a sense of the general rise and develop a ramp and a run?
	- No stick with your plan, but talk to mark about it
