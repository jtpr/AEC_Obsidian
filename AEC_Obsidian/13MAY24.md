# Record

		- Standard Gear and Protection
			- Sun block
			- A hat
			- Billowy clothes
			- Shorts on hot days are okay, I normally change but that's up to you
		- How to decide what to fix
			- Grinding
				- 0.5-3 inches can be ground
				- Don't grind if it'll create ponding water
				- Avoid special concrete slabs (rings, inlays, near pavers)
			- Slab Jacking
				- If it's along two sides its generally better, one corner is not the best candiate
			- Patching
				- Chipped hole in the concrete
			- Remove and Replace
				- No other solution
				- Multiple cracks, or ponding
			- Sawcut
				- Used to add areas to R&R jobs, or replace smaller pieces
			- Expansion Joints
				- Replace deteriorating expansion joints
				- Should they be used to fill larger gaps between slabs?
			- Truncated Dome
				- Used at each side of a road crosswalk
				- 
		- Can we get a meeting with Sue Gott to try and triage some of our fixes?
			- Yes --> Anne will bring up
	- Do we need to help out Jackie at all?
		- No
	- Prioritization
		- Print off
		- Don't start with Northwood
		- Prioritize
			- NW5

- Making the Auxiliary Unit File
	- This is really messy for some reason. Honestly, maybe more worth it to just remake the whole thing in AutoCAD
	- I just printed the 2016 version :/
